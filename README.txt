Sharne created the heuristic. It is a sum of the pieces on the board after a move, with additional weight given to pieces in the corners or on the edges. She implemented the doMove function that was compatible with the heuristic, which was eventually replaced with minimax.

Malia implemented the initialization of the othello bot. She also created the minimax. The minimax algorithm allows the bot to look at the possible moves and look forward a certain depth to determine the best move. She added mobility to the heuristic (minimize the opponent's mobility).

To improve the AI, we implemented a heuristic and created minimax. We also
